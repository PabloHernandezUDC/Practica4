class Activity():
    '''
    Class that represents an activity that can have a name, duration, number of participants, and cost.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the activity.
    duration : float
        Duration in minutes of said activity.
    participants : float
        Number of people particpating in the activity.
    cost: float
        Monetary cost of the activity.
    
    Methods
    -------
    __lt__(self, other):
        Overriding the magic method for < so that activities are sorted according to their total cost.
    
    get_total_needed_resources(self):
        Calculates total cost for an activity based on the current values of some of its attributes.
        (cost / participants / duration in hours)

    Getters and setters for all attributes.   
    '''
    
    def __init__(self, name, duration, participants, cost):
